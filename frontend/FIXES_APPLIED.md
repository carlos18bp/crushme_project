# Fixes Applied - i18n and Scroll Issues

## Date: 2025-10-16

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Language Mismatch Between URL and Content

**Problem:** When accessing the app for the first time (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5173/en`), the content would display in Spanish instead of English, and vice versa.

**Root Cause:** The i18n store was detecting the user's language based on IP geolocation and immediately setting it, before the router could process the URL language parameter. This caused a race condition where the detected language would override the URL language.

**Solution:**
- Modified `i18nStore.js` to store the detected locale in a separate `detectedLocale` state without automatically applying it
- Updated the router's `beforeEach` guard to:
  - Wait for language detection to complete
  - Always prioritize the URL language over the detected language
  - Use detected language only when redirecting from root path or when no language is in the URL
- Updated the root redirect to use `detectedLocale` when available

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/stores/modules/i18nStore.js`
- `/src/router/index.js`

### 2. Scroll Disabled After Navigation

**Problem:** When navigating from authentication views or dashboard views to other pages (like shop or home), the scroll would be disabled and users couldn't navigate pages with scrollable content.

**Root Cause:** Authentication views had global `body { overflow: hidden !important; }` styles that persisted after navigation to other views. These styles were not scoped and remained active even after leaving the auth pages.

**Solution:**
- Removed all global `body { overflow: hidden !important; }` styles from authentication views
- Kept only the scoped styles on the view containers (e.g., `.login-view`, `.signup-view`, etc.)
- The scoped `overflow: hidden` on the fixed-position containers is sufficient to prevent scrolling within those views

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/views/auth/LoginView.vue`
- `/src/views/auth/RegisterView.vue`
- `/src/views/auth/VerificationView.vue`
- `/src/views/auth/ForgotPasswordView.vue`
- `/src/views/auth/ResetCodeView.vue`
- `/src/views/auth/ResetPasswordView.vue`

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Language URL Matching
1. Clear browser cache and local storage
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/en` - Content should be in English
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/es` - Content should be in Spanish
4. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` - Should redirect to detected language based on IP

### Test 2: Scroll Functionality
1. Navigate to any auth page (e.g., `/en/login`)
2. Verify scroll is disabled on that page (as intended)
3. Navigate to home page (`/en/`) or shop page (`/en/products`)
4. Verify scroll works properly on these pages
5. Navigate back to auth pages and then to other pages again
6. Verify scroll continues to work correctly

## Technical Details

### i18n Flow
1. App initializes and Pinia store is created
2. `initializeIfNeeded()` is called, which runs IP detection
3. Detected locale is stored in `detectedLocale` (not applied to UI)
4. Router guard runs and checks URL for language parameter
5. If URL has language, it's applied to the store
6. If no URL language, detected locale is used for redirect

### Scroll Management
- Auth views use `position: fixed` with `overflow: hidden` on their container
- This prevents scrolling within the view without affecting global body styles
- When navigating away, the container is unmounted and scroll returns to normal
- No JavaScript cleanup needed - Vue handles component lifecycle automatically
